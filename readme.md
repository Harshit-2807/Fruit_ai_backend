# Fruit.ai FAQ API Backend

This project is a backend API for handling FAQs related to fruits. It is built using Flask and provides basic CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for FAQs. This backend API can be integrated with any frontend application to handle FAQ data dynamically.

## Features
- **GET all FAQs**: Fetch all FAQ data.
- **GET a single FAQ**: Fetch a specific FAQ by its ID.
- **POST a new FAQ**: Create a new FAQ.
- **PUT to update a FAQ**: Update an existing FAQ by its ID.
- **DELETE a FAQ**: Delete an FAQ by its ID.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Python-based lightweight web framework.
- **Flask-CORS**: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and allow API usage from different domains.
- **Python**: Core language used for the backend.
- **REST API**: CRUD functionality to manage FAQs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-ai-backend.git
cd fruit-ai-backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Access the API locally at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/faqs](http://127.0.0.1:5000/faqs).

## Deployment

You can deploy the Flask app on any platform that supports Python web apps. Hereâ€™s a simple guide for deploying to Render:

1. Sign up for a Render account.
2. Create a new Web Service on Render.
3. Connect your GitHub repository.
4. Set the build command to:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Set the start command to:

```bash
python app.py
```

Render will build and deploy your app. The deployed backend can be accessed at the provided Render URL.

## CORS

The API uses Flask-CORS to allow cross-origin requests from different domains. If integrating this API with a frontend application, ensure that the domain of the frontend is allowed in CORS configuration.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for persistent FAQ storage.
- Implement authentication for managing FAQs.
- Add more FAQs to cover a broader range of fruit-related questions.
